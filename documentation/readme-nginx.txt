Here is tutorial for using nginx server:

Note:
- I assume that nginx hasbeen already running in Your server
- In this tutorial I used webuzo control panel web

1. Open PUTTY or WINSCP
2. Edit file /usr/local/apps/nginx/etc/conf.d/common
3. Paste this configuration code on the last line

location / { 
rewrite ^/([^/]*)\.html /index.php?p=$1 last;  
rewrite ^/([^/]*)/([^/]*)\.html /index.php?p=$1&s=$2 last;
rewrite ^/([^/]*)/([^/]*)/([^/]*)\.html /index.php?p=$1&id=$2&s=$3 last;
rewrite ^/error.html /acp/404.php last;
error_page 404 /error.html;
}

location ~* \.(?:ico|css|js|gif|jpe?g|png|pdf)$ {
    expires 30d;
    add_header Pragma public;
    add_header Cache-Control "public";
}

4. Don't forget to Save it
5. Open file /usr/local/apps/nginx/etc/conf.d/WebuzoVH.conf
6. Make sure there is code like this below :

server {	
	listen		*:80;
	server_name	javelinee.com;
	# The Document Root
	root		/home/xsilent/www/javelinee.com;	
	error_log	/usr/local/apps/nginx/var/log/javelinee.com.err;
	access_log	/usr/local/apps/nginx/var/log/javelinee.com.log main;
	include	/usr/local/apps/nginx/etc/conf.d/common;
	
}

server {	
	listen		*:80;
	server_name	www.javelinee.com;
	# The Document Root
	root		/home/xsilent/www/javelinee.com;	
	error_log	/usr/local/apps/nginx/var/log/javelinee.com.err;
	access_log	/usr/local/apps/nginx/var/log/javelinee.com.log main;
	include	/usr/local/apps/nginx/etc/conf.d/common;
	rewrite ^(.*) http://javelinee.com$1 permanent;
}

7. Don't edit anything because it generated by Webuzo automatically.
8. It's all done, Javelinee will run in nginx server.
